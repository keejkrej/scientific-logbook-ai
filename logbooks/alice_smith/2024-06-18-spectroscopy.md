# UV-Vis Spectroscopy of Protein Samples

## Experiment
Determined protein concentrations using UV-Vis spectroscopy at 280nm.

### Samples:
- Lysozyme preparations (3 different batches)
- BSA standard solutions
- Buffer blanks

### Method:
- Measured absorbance at 280nm using NanoDrop
- Used extinction coefficient for lysozyme: 36,000 M⁻¹cm⁻¹
- Triplicate measurements for each sample

## Results
Lysozyme concentrations:
- Batch 1: 12.3 mg/ml
- Batch 2: 9.8 mg/ml  
- Batch 3: 11.1 mg/ml

A280/A260 ratios all >1.8, indicating good protein purity.

## Observations
- All samples showed clean UV spectra
- No significant nucleic acid contamination
- Batch 2 slightly lower concentration than expected
- Good reproducibility between measurements

## Next Steps
- Use these concentrations for crystallization setup
- Store aliquots at -80°C
- Verify by Bradford assay
