# Protein Crystallization Experiment - Lysozyme

## Experiment
Today I set up crystallization trials for lysozyme protein using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. 

### Materials:
- Lysozyme protein solution (10 mg/ml in 0.1M acetate buffer, pH 4.5)
- Precipitant: 1.5M NaCl in 0.1M acetate buffer
- 24-well crystallization plates

### Procedure:
1. Mixed 2μl protein solution with 2μl precipitant solution
2. Placed drop on coverslip over 500μl reservoir solution
3. Sealed wells and incubated at 20°C

## Results
After 3 days, observed small cubic crystals forming in wells 1, 3, and 7. Crystal size approximately 0.1-0.2mm.

## Observations
- Wells with higher salt concentration showed better crystal formation
- Temperature seems optimal at 20°C
- Need to optimize protein concentration for larger crystals

## Next Steps
- Scale up successful conditions
- Prepare crystals for X-ray diffraction
- Try additive screening to improve crystal quality
