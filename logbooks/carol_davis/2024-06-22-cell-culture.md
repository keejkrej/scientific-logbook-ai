# HeLa Cell Culture - Drug Treatment Assay

## Experiment
Testing the cytotoxic effects of compound CD-123 on HeLa cells using MTT assay.

### Cell Culture:
- HeLa cells passage 15
- Grown in DMEM + 10% FBS + 1% P/S
- Seeded at 5,000 cells/well in 96-well plates
- Incubated overnight at 37°C, 5% CO2

### Drug Treatment:
- Compound CD-123 dissolved in DMSO
- Serial dilutions: 100μM to 0.1μM
- Treated for 48 hours
- DMSO control (0.1% final concentration)

## Results
IC50 calculated at approximately 25μM after 48h treatment.

Cell viability measurements:
- 100μM: 15% viable
- 50μM: 35% viable  
- 25μM: 52% viable
- 12.5μM: 78% viable
- Control: 100% viable

## Observations
- Cells showed morphological changes at concentrations >25μM
- Significant cell detachment at highest concentrations
- DMSO control showed no toxicity
- Dose-response curve fits well to sigmoidal model

## Next Steps
- Repeat experiment with different cell lines
- Test shorter time points (24h, 12h)
- Investigate mechanism of action
- Western blot for apoptosis markers
