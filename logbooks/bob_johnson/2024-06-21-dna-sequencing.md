# DNA Sequencing Analysis - Sample BJ001

## Experiment
Performed PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene from environmental sample BJ001.

### PCR Setup:
- Template: Environmental DNA extract (50ng)
- Primers: 27F and 1492R (universal bacterial primers)
- Taq polymerase with standard buffer
- Annealing temperature: 55Â°C, 30 cycles

### Sequencing:
- Used BigDye Terminator v3.1 chemistry
- Sequenced on ABI 3730xl
- Both forward and reverse reactions

## Results
Successfully amplified ~1.5kb fragment. Sequencing quality scores >30 for 95% of bases.

BLAST analysis shows 98% identity to *Escherichia coli* strain K-12.

## Observations
- PCR amplification was clean with single band
- No contamination detected in negative controls
- Forward sequence quality better than reverse
- Some ambiguous bases at position 450-470

## Next Steps
- Repeat sequencing reaction for reverse primer to clarify ambiguous region
- Perform phylogenetic analysis
- Compare with other environmental samples
