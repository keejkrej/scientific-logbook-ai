## Experiment

Today, I initiated protein crystallization trials using lysozyme as the model protein. The procedure was as follows:

- **Protein Preparation:** Approximately 10 mg of lysozyme was dissolved in buffer.
- **Buffer Conditions:** The solution was prepared in Tris buffer, pH ~7.0 (exact pH should be confirmed with a calibrated pH meter).
- **Precipitant Solution:** A salt solution containing approximately 1 M NaCl and 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) was prepared. The precise molecular weight of PEG used should be specified in future records.
- **Crystallization Setup:** Hanging drop vapor diffusion method was employed. Each drop consisted of 2 μL protein solution mixed with 2 μL precipitant solution, placed on a cover slip and suspended over a reservoir containing the precipitant solution.
- **Incubation Conditions:** The setup was incubated at room temperature (~20–22°C).

## Results

- After several hours of incubation, small crystals were observed in the hanging drop.
- The crystals appeared to be rectangular in shape.
- No quantitative measurements (e.g., crystal size, number per drop) were recorded at this stage.

## Observations

- Initial crystal formation was evident within a few hours, indicating that the chosen conditions are conducive to lysozyme crystallization.
- Crystal morphology was predominantly rectangular.
- No signs of precipitation or amorphous aggregation were observed.
- The exact concentration of lysozyme, NaCl, and PEG, as well as the drop and reservoir volumes, should be recorded more precisely in future experiments.
- Temperature was not strictly controlled or monitored; future experiments should use a calibrated thermometer.

## Next Steps

- **Optimization of Conditions:**
  - Test a range of NaCl concentrations to determine optimal conditions for larger crystal growth.
  - Vary PEG concentration and record the molecular weight used.
  - Explore different buffer systems and pH values for improved crystal quality.
- **Temperature Variation:**
  - Repeat crystallization trials at lower temperature (e.g., 4°C) to assess effects on crystal size and morphology.
- **Documentation:**
  - Record all reagent concentrations, drop and reservoir volumes, and incubation times with greater precision.
  - Capture images of crystals for documentation and further analysis.
  - Measure and record crystal dimensions and count per drop.
- **Further Analysis:**
  - If suitable crystals are obtained, proceed with X-ray diffraction analysis to assess crystal quality.

*Note: For reproducibility, ensure all experimental parameters are documented in detail in subsequent trials.*
